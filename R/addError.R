#' Our definitions of common R errors are great! But you will run into many more!
#' This function allows you to add your own terms to the database on your computer.
#' What does this mean? You can make your own R notes that you can search at any time.
#' If you're working on a long term project, have you ever had an error you KNOW
#' you solved previously but now you can't remember?
#'
#' Use addDefinition() and make yourself some notes for later!
#'
#' @param itemToDefine the error you're going to save a definition/information for
#' @param definitionNotes the text you're going to save as the definition. Include
#' things like a brief decsription of what the problem was, links to the websites
#' that helped you solve it, the date you're making the defintion and the file names
#' where your problems occurred.
#'
#' @return successText a message letting you know whether your save was successful or not.
#' @export
#'
