Title: Get Help When Starting Out in R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Steph de Silva
Maintainer: Steph de Silva <steph@rex-analytics.com>
Description: Starting out with R can be overwhelming. Error messages in particular
    can appear to be in some kind of arcane language no regular human would understand.
    We can assure you that after a very short period, it all becomes clear - but in the
    meantime, it's pretty confusing. helpPlease provides a number of function that allow you to access plain language explanations
    and tips that have worked for other R users.
